## Features

- Easily editable and processable file format based on [YAML]
- Modeled on transactions instead of debiting / crediting accounts
    => Support for complex transactions made up of several transfers
    - Dedicated payer (from) and payee (to) fields (ledger only supports payee)
- No misuse of accounts as categories / tags
    => Direct support for tags
- Clear separation between
    - Physical account (e.g. wallet, bank account)
    - Entities (e.g. my mum, a company)
    - Purpose of transaction (e.g. food, travel)
- No hard-coded asset / liability connotation as it is viewpoint dependent
    => Choose viewpoint by setting the owner of the journal
- Initial balances
- High precision timestamps in ISO 8601 format
- Reference external files (e.g. receipts, contracts, bank statements, ‚Ä¶)
- Safety checks
    - BigInt fractional numbers to eliminate rounding errors
    - Verifies exclusive use of predefined entities
    - Checks in transactions match with verification balances
    - Checks that referenced external files exist
        and that all external files are referenced
- Export to other formats for post-processing
    - [Gnuplot] (for trends)
    - [(H)ledger Format] (for using (H)ledger exclusive features)
    - CSV and TSV (for further processing in spreadsheet software)
    - XLSX aka Excel (for further processing in spreadsheet software)
- Multi file support

## Installation

Transity is distributed as a JavaScript bundle and can therefore
be installed via [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```sh
bun install --global transity
```


## License

While Transity is licensed under the AGPL-3.0-or-later
and can therefore be used free of charge,
I hope you will acknowledge the work and effort
it takes to maintain and improve this software
and make a donation via my [GitHub Support page].

If you find Transity valuable and/or use it regularly this should
be a small nuisance for you, but it would mean the world for me!
It would mean that I can spend more time on this project
and bring it to the next level!

Thanks a lot for your support!

### Check Order of Entries

Check if all entries are in a chronological order

```sh
ag --nonumbers "^    utc:" journals/main.yaml | tr -d "\'" | sort -c
```


### Retrieving Data from Banks

Transity includes a few scripts located at [./scripts](./scripts) to
automate a Chrome browser to download data.
It supports downloading CSV files of all
transactions and converting them to journal
files and retrieving the current account balance:

Currently supported accounts for transactions:

- [DKB Visa Card](https://dkb.de)
- [DKB Giro Account](https://dkb.de)
- [HypoVereinsbank](https://www.hypovereinsbank.de)
- [MBS](https://mbs.de)

Currently supported accounts for balances:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
- [DKB](https://dkb.de)
- [Fidor](https://fidor.de)
- [Finvesto](https://finvesto.de)
- [HypoVereinsbank](https://www.hypovereinsbank.de)
- [MBS](https://mbs.de)
- [PayPal](https://paypal.com)
- [Deutsche Post Petty Cash](https://portokasse.deutschepost.de)

Contributions are very welcome!


#### Script Usage

```sh
node scripts/transactions/hypovereinsbank.js > transactions.yaml
```

This will prompt you for your credentials and afterwards automate
a headless Chrome instance to download and convert the data.


## Journal File Format

A minimal journal file is a YAML file with following format:

```yaml
owner: anna
commodities:
  - id: ‚Ç¨
    name: Euro
    alias:
      - EUR
    note: Currency used in the European Union
    utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:53'

entities:
  - id: anna
    name: Anna Smith
    utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:28'
    tags:
      - person
    accounts:
      - id: wallet
        name: Wallet
        note: Anna's black wallet
        utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:28'
        tags:
          - wallet

  - id: evil-corp
    name: Evil Corporation
    utc: '2017-04-02 19:33:28'
    note: The Evil Corporation in the United States of Evil
    tags:
      - company

transactions:
  - title: Purchase of evil machine
    transfers:
      - utc: '2017-02-17'
        from: anna
        to: evil-corp
        amount: 50000 ‚Ç¨
      - utc: '2017-02-17'
        from: evil-corp
        to: anna
        amount: 1 evil-machine
```


## Plotting

By default all accounts are plotted.
To limit it to only a subsection use `awk` to filter the output.

For example all transactions of Euro accounts:

```bash
transity gplot examples/journal.yaml \
| awk '/^$/ || /(EOD|^set terminal)/ || /‚Ç¨/' \
| gnuplot \
| imgcat
```


Or all account balances of Euro accounts over time:

```bash
transity gplot-cumul examples/journal.yaml \
| awk '/^$/ || /(EOD|^set terminal)/ || /‚Ç¨/' \
| gnuplot \
| imgcat
```

## Import

### AI Powered

We built a dedicated OpenAI GPT to convert any financial data
(e.g. CSVs, bank statements, chat history, ‚Ä¶) to a Transity journal file.

Check it out at
[chat.openai.com/g/g-aUph953Vj-transity](
  https://chat.openai.com/g/g-aUph953Vj-transity).


### From Ledger CLI

Execute the included ledger2transity script:

```shell
./ledger2transity.sh examples/hledger.journal > transactions.csv
```

Convert `transactions.csv` to YAML with e.g. [browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml]

[browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml]: https://browserling.com/tools/csv-to-yaml


**Attention:**

- Merge adjacent entries as each entry only debits / credits an account.
  A transaction always involves 2 accounts (`from` and `to`).
  (For expenses basically copy the ledger-account from the second entry
  into the `from` field of the first entry)
- `from` and `to` might be reversed for income
  (depending on how the `payee` field was used)
- Account names of Ledger-CLI are interpreted as tags
  Transity understands accounts as **physical accounts**
- The note is duplicated in the `tags` field.
  There is no way to get only the tags in Ledger-CLI üòî


## FAQ

### Why another plain text accounting tool?

Existing accounting tools are historically based on the notion of an account.
You add money (debit) and you remove money (credit).
(If this sounds backwards to you, read [this explanation])

[this explanation]:
  http://simplerestaurantaccounting.com/debit-and-credit-accounting-terminology-is-confusing

For example you get 50 ‚Ç¨ from your mum and buy some food for 20 ‚Ç¨.

```txt
Account | Debit   | Credit
--------|---------|--------
Wallet  | 50.00 ‚Ç¨ |
Wallet  |         | 20.00 ‚Ç¨
---------------------------
```

Simple, but also incomplete.
Where did the money come from, where did it go?
This led to double entry bookkeeping.
Whenever you add some money to an account,
you have to remove the same amount from another.


```txt
Account | Debit   | Credit
--------|---------|--------
Wallet  | 50.00 ‚Ç¨ |
Mum     |         | 50.00 ‚Ç¨
Wallet  |         | 20.00 ‚Ç¨
Food    | 20.00 ‚Ç¨ |
---------------------------
```

But you *must never forget a posting*,
because otherwise your account won't balance.

```txt
Account | Debit   | Credit
--------|---------|--------
Wallet  | 50.00 ‚Ç¨ |
Mum     |         | 50.00 ‚Ç¨
Wallet  |         | 20.00 ‚Ç¨
---------------------------
```

Oops, where did the money go? ü§∑‚Äç

If this looks (and sounds) confusing or too complicated, you're not alone!
It made sense in former times as this layout makes it easier
to add up the amounts by hand, but not in times of computers.

So how can we simplify it?
It's actually quite easy:
We just have to model it in terms of transactions, and not accounts.

```txt
Amount | From   | To
-------|--------|--------
50 ‚Ç¨   | Mum    | Wallet
20 ‚Ç¨   | Wallet | Food
-------------------------
```

- Simple - No more confusing debit / credit / asset / liability mumbo jumbo
- Intuitive - Just like you would talk about it
- Safe - It's obvious if you forget to fill out a field

Together with some further changes it yields an
**easier to understand, more robust and more complete**
representation of accounting!


### Why is it written in PureScript?

PureScript leverages strong static typing and can therefore
give more guarantees about the functionality of the code
than weakly typed or untyped languages (like JavaScript).

You wouldn't want your money to get lost in rounding errors or
be turned to `undefined`, would you? üòâ


### Why is it not written in Haskell?

PureScript can also easily be used in the browser or get deployed
as a cloud function as it simply compiles to JavaScript.
With Haskell you'd have to use another language for a web frontend
or quarrel with experimental stuff like [GHCJS].

[GHCJS]: https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs


## Comparison with Hledger

(H)ledger's transactions are a (balanced) group of account postings.
Transity's transactions are a group of transfers between two accounts.


### Syntax

Checkout the files [hledger.journal] and [journal.yaml]
for similar transactions modeled in Hledger and in Transity.

[hledger.journal]: ./examples/hledger.journal
[journal.yaml]: ./examples/journal.yaml


There is a lot of ambiguity in the ledger journal format.
Are you able to tell the difference between the 2 options?


```ledger
2019-01-17 Bought food
  expenses:food  $10
  assets:cash

; vs

2019-01-17 Bought food
  assets:cash
  expenses:food  $10
```

Also, it lacks some fields for more precise recording
of which parties where involved.

- What food?
- Where did you buy it?
- When exactly did you buy it?
- Which supermarket?

```ledger
2019-01-17 Bought food
  expenses:food  $10
  assets:cash
```

### Reporting

```shell
hledger --file examples/hledger.journal balance
# vs
transity balance examples/journal.yaml
```

```shell
hledger --file examples/hledger.journal register
# vs
transity transactions examples/journal.yaml
```

```shell
hledger --file examples/hledger.journal register --output-format=csv
# vs
transity entries examples/journal.yaml
```


### Missing features

- No support for precise timestamps (transactions only have an associated date)
- No first class support for Gnuplot
  (Check out [Report Scripts for Ledger CLI with Gnuplot] for some scripts)

[Report Scripts for Ledger CLI with Gnuplot]:
  https://www.sundialdreams.com/report-scripts-for-ledger-cli-with-gnuplot


### Performance

Measured with hyperfine including 3 warmups on an early 2015 MacBook Pro.

*For a journal file with around 2000 entries:*

    1. Certification - Acknowledgment that exchange was performed

[Graphviz]: https://graphviz.org
[JS-Sequence-Diagrams]: https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams


### Entry / Value Date

There are no separate fields for entry or value dates necessary.
Simply use ISO 8601 [time intervals] to specify the duration of a transfer.

[time intervals]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals

```yaml
transactions:
  - id: '123456789'
    note: Deposit of savings
    transfers:
      - utc: 2018-01-04T12:00--05T22:10
        from: john
        to: bank
        amount: 100 ‚Ç¨
```


### Syntax

This is a first concept of an alternative syntax for the journal file:

```transity
# Comments after a hash

2016-04-16 18:50:28
| 1 year registration of domain "example.org"
+tagOne  # Tags are written after a plus
+tagTwo
id: 20135604  # Arbitrary metadata
# Transactions are indentend by 2 spaces
  john -> paypal : 9.95 ‚Ç¨
  paypal -> namecheap : {10 + 0.69} $
  paypal -> icann : 0.18 $ +fee
  namecheap -> john : 1 Domain
```
