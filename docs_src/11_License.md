## License

While Transity is licensed under the [AGPL-3.0-or-later]
and can therefore be used free of charge,
I hope you will acknowledge the work and effort
it takes to maintain and improve this software
and make a donation via my [GitHub Support page].

If you find Transity valuable and/or use it regularly this should
be a small nuisance for you, but it would mean a lot to me.
It would mean that I can spend more time on this project
and bring it to the next level!

Thanks a lot for your support!
